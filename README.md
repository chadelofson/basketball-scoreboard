# Basketball Scoreboard (Solo Project)

The Basketball Scoreboard is a tiny app that allows you to add 1, 2, or 3 points to the home or guest team.  The team with the lead score gets highlighted.  There is a button to reset the scoreboard back to 0 for both teams.

This project is part of the Scrimba Frontend Career Path
